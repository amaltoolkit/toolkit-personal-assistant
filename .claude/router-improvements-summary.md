# Router Prompt Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-06

## Overview
Enhanced the LLM-based router with context-aware routing capabilities to improve accuracy for multi-turn conversations and entity-aware queries.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Function Signature ✅
**File**: `api/services/llmPlanner.js:46`

**Before:**
```javascript
async createExecutionPlan(query, memoryContext = null)
```

**After:**
```javascript
async createExecutionPlan(query, memoryContext = null, entityStats = null, recentMessages = [])
```

**Impact**: Planner now receives full context about session state and conversation history.

---

### 2. Added Entity State Context ✅
**File**: `api/services/llmPlanner.js:67-76`

**Added to prompt:**
```
Current session state (entities created so far):
- Workflows: X created
- Appointments: Y created
- Tasks: Z created

IMPORTANT: If user asks about entities that don't exist yet (count = 0),
route to general for helpful response.
```

**Impact**:
- Router knows what entities exist before making routing decision
- "What was step 2?" correctly routes to general when workflow exists
- "Show my workflows" routes to general (read operation) vs "Create workflow" → workflow (action)

---

### 3. Added Conversation History ✅
**File**: `api/services/llmPlanner.js:78-87`

**Added to prompt:**
```
Recent conversation (for context):
User: Create a client onboarding workflow
Assistant: Successfully created workflow...

Use this conversation history to resolve pronouns ("it", "that", "the workflow")
and implicit references.
```

**Impact**:
- Multi-turn conversations now work correctly
- "Change it to 3pm" can understand what "it" refers to from context
- Follow-up questions get proper routing

---

### 4. Clarified Domain Descriptions ✅
**File**: `api/services/llmPlanner.js:61-65`

**Before:**
```
- calendar: Creating/viewing appointments [ACTION]
- general: Answering questions, conversations [INFORMATIONAL]
```

**After:**
```
- calendar: Creating appointments, meetings, scheduling events [ACTION]
- general: Answering questions, viewing/reading existing entities, conversations [INFORMATIONAL]
```

**Impact**:
- Clear separation: creation = action, viewing = informational
- "Show my appointments" → general (not calendar)
- "Create appointment" → calendar

---

### 5. Enhanced JSON Output Schema ✅
**File**: `api/services/llmPlanner.js:128-147`

**Added fields:**
```json
{
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "analysis": {
    "intent": "create|read|converse",
    "entities_referenced": ["workflow", "appointment"],
    "requires_context": true,
    "reasoning": "Step-by-step: 1. Detected X, 2. User has Y entities, 3. Route to Z"
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Better debugging with confidence scores
- Intent detection helps validate routing decisions
- Detailed reasoning shows LLM's thought process

---

### 6. Updated Coordinator Integration ✅
**File**: `api/coordinator/index.js:451-471`

**Added:**
```javascript
// Get entity statistics for context-aware routing
const entityStats = state.entities ? this.entityManager.getStats(state.entities) : null;

// Get recent messages (last 6 messages = 3 turns)
const recentMessages = state.messages ? state.messages.slice(-6) : [];

// Pass to planner
const executionPlan = await createExecutionPlan(
  lastMessage.content,
  state.memory_context,
  entityStats,
  recentMessages
);
```

**Impact**: Coordinator now provides full context to router automatically.

---

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅

**Test 1**: General subgraph loads successfully
**Test 2**: Conversational queries route to 'general'
- "Hey, what's up?" ✅
- "What was the second step?" ✅
- "Show all my workflows" ✅
- "How many workflows did I create?" ✅
- "Thanks, goodbye" ✅

**Test 3**: Action queries route correctly
- "Create a client onboarding workflow" → workflow ✅
- "Schedule a meeting" → calendar ✅
- "Add a task" → task ✅
- "Find contact Sarah Smith" → contact ✅

**Test 4**: Context-aware routing
- "What was step 2?" (with workflow in session) → general ✅
- "Show all my workflows" (with workflow in session) → general ✅

---

## Key Improvements Summary

### Before
- ❌ Router had no knowledge of session state
- ❌ Multi-turn conversations didn't work
- ❌ "viewing" vs "creating" was ambiguous
- ❌ No debugging information (confidence, intent)
- ❌ "What was step 2?" might route to workflow agent incorrectly

### After
- ✅ Router knows what entities exist in session
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations work via message history
- ✅ Clear distinction: viewing = general, creating = action
- ✅ Rich debugging info (confidence, intent, reasoning)
- ✅ "What was step 2?" correctly routes to general agent

---

## Production Usage

When deployed with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the LLM router will:

1. **Analyze query intent** (create/read/converse)
2. **Check entity state** (what exists in session)
3. **Review conversation history** (resolve pronouns and references)
4. **Return detailed analysis** with confidence score
5. **Fallback to keyword router** if LLM fails (safety net)

### Example LLM Output
```json
{
  "parallel": ["general"],
  "sequential": [],
  "confidence": "high",
  "analysis": {
    "intent": "read",
    "entities_referenced": ["workflow"],
    "requires_context": true,
    "reasoning": "1. User asks 'What was step 2?' which is a read query. 2. Session has 1 workflow. 3. Route to general agent to answer question about existing workflow."
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **api/services/llmPlanner.js** - Router logic and prompt
2. **api/coordinator/index.js** - Pass context to router
3. **api/test-general-agent.js** - Enhanced test coverage

---

## Next Steps (Future)

- Add examples for modification operations when that feature is built
- Add examples for deletion operations when that feature is built
- Consider adding confidence threshold (e.g., if confidence < 0.7, ask clarifying question)
- Monitor LLM routing accuracy in production logs
