# Migration Complete ✅

## Folder Structure Reorganization - COMPLETED

The project has been successfully reorganized from a flat structure to a modular, scalable architecture.

## What Changed

### Directory Structure
- ✅ `api/` → `src/` with organized subdirectories
- ✅ `extension/` → `client/` with better grouping
- ✅ Tests consolidated in `tests/` directory
- ✅ Documentation consolidated in `docs/` directory

### Key Improvements
1. **Agent Architecture** - Each domain agent is self-contained
2. **Core Infrastructure** - Separated state, memory, auth, websocket
3. **Service Grouping** - Related services grouped by domain
4. **Integration Isolation** - All BSA code in one place
5. **Better Testing** - Tests organized by type
6. **Documentation** - All docs in logical hierarchy

## Updated Configuration Files

### ✅ langgraph.json
- Updated all graph paths to point to `src/agents/`

### ✅ vercel.json
- Updated entry point to `src/server.js`

### ✅ package.json
- Updated main field to `src/server.js`
- Updated start/dev scripts

### ✅ client/manifest.json
- Updated sidepanel path to `sidepanel/index.html`
- Updated icon paths to `assets/icons/`
- Updated web_accessible_resources

## Import Path Updates

All imports have been updated throughout the codebase:

### Backend
- ✅ Coordinator and all domain agents
- ✅ Routes (agent.js, monitoring.js)
- ✅ Main server (src/server.js)
- ✅ BSA tools (appointments, contacts, tasks, workflows)
- ✅ Services (entities, planning, memory, sync, errors)
- ✅ Core modules (state, memory, auth, websocket)

### Frontend
- ✅ Client manifest paths
- ✅ Sidepanel HTML script/style references
- ✅ Component paths

## Next Steps for Development

### 1. Verify the Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test LangGraph Studio
npm run studio
```

### 2. Load Chrome Extension
1. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `client/` directory (NOT `extension/`)

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Old Directories

The old `api/` and `extension/` directories are still present for safety but are no longer used. They can be removed once you've verified everything works:

```bash
# Remove old directories (after verification)
rm -rf api/
rm -rf extension/
rm -rf .claude/
```

## Quick Reference

### Common File Locations

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `api/index.js` | `src/server.js` |
| `api/coordinator/index.js` | `src/agents/coordinator/index.js` |
| `api/subgraphs/calendar.js` | `src/agents/domains/calendar/graph.js` |
| `api/tools/bsa/appointments.js` | `src/integrations/bsa/tools/appointments.js` |
| `api/services/entityManager.js` | `src/services/entities/entityManager.js` |
| `api/graph/state.js` | `src/core/state/schema.js` |
| `api/lib/dateParser.js` | `src/utils/dateParser.js` |
| `extension/sidepanel.html` | `client/sidepanel/index.html` |
| `extension/sidepanel.js` | `client/sidepanel/index.js` |
| `.claude/docs/` | `docs/` |

### Import Patterns

When writing new code, follow these patterns:

```javascript
// Core modules
const { getCheckpointer } = require('../../core/state');
const { getMem0Service } = require('../../services/memory/mem0Service');

// BSA integration
const bsaConfig = require('../../integrations/bsa/config');
const { getAppointments } = require('../../integrations/bsa/tools/appointments');

// Services
const { getEntityManager } = require('../../services/entities/entityManager');
const { getContactResolver } = require('../../services/entities/contactResolver');

// Utils
const { parseDateQuery } = require('../../utils/dateParser');
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Chrome Extension Doesn't Load
1. Make sure you're loading from `client/` directory
2. Check that all icon files exist in `client/assets/icons/`
3. Verify manifest.json paths are correct

### If Backend Fails to Start
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Check that PostgreSQL connection string is valid
3. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### If LangGraph Studio Can't Find Graphs
1. Check `langgraph.json` paths
2. Verify graph files exist at specified locations
3. Ensure `graph` export exists in each agent file

### If Tests Fail
1. Update any test file imports to new paths
2. Check that test data/fixtures are accessible
3. Verify environment variables for tests

## Success Criteria

✅ All configuration files updated  
✅ All backend imports updated  
✅ All frontend paths updated  
✅ Documentation updated  
✅ README reflects new structure  

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback:
1. The old `api/` and `extension/` directories still exist
2. Revert configuration files:
   - `git checkout langgraph.json vercel.json package.json`
3. Revert client manifest:
   - `git checkout extension/manifest.json`
4. Remove new directories and restore from git
